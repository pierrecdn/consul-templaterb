   will work only Consul 1.9+ (see [Consul #7527](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/7527)). 

## 1.29.0 (Oct 6, 2020)

## 1.28.0 (Sept 25, 2020)

   used to perform Consul queries. It might be useful for very large clusters or large WAN federations,
   because you can perform some requests on some agents, and some others on other agenrs. Might
   also be useful to federate data from preprod/prod for instance.
 * Added agent attribute for all methods in documentation
 * Added [samples/all_services_multi_agents.txt.erb](samples/all_services_multi_agents.txt.erb) as an
   example of new feature.

service/node meta. You can tune output of prometheus labels with the environment
variable `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTED_SERVICE_META` which contains the keys separated by
commas to extract from Service.Meta or Node.Meta.

BUG FIXES:

 * When default value was the same as real value, endpoints were always marked as
   dirty, thus rendering of templates did never succeed.
   Since default value for service was '[]', trying to fetch a non-existing service
   did forbid templates to converge.

## 1.9.7 (January 15, 2019)
